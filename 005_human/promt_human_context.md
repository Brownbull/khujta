I want to define a JSON file with the structure of human context. Like the files we are starting to creare for AI to give more context about how to create the response, precious variables, desired style of action, and so on, I want a similar file so AI can know better what is capable a human to proceed quickly, and in that way derive patterns to proceed in complex systems building, for example an ai can easily create an app with multi parts, like get data from photos , extract relevant words, get meaning and create data frame, save data, create spreadsheets and reports. But a human might get better understanding of the app parts if instead of creating the whole app at once, the AI create littles cycles, and iterates in them, until reaching the desalired final app. This way the human can get how the app is working starting small and going step by step making the app more robust until the desired point. Also please create a tier system for apps based in this, from basic fast human understanding to full flesh prod apps that require a. Lot of human iterations to reach understanding
