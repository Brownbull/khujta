Review current infrastructure performance metrics\n   - Check security alerts and vulnerability reports\n   - Validate compliance status across all systems\n\n2. **Architecture Alignment Check**\n   - Assess current system patterns against upcoming features from VIVA\n   - Identify potential bottlenecks or scalability issues\n   - Review technical debt and optimization opportunities\n\n3. **Security & Compliance Validation**\n   - Run automated security scans\n   - Verify compliance with healthcare regulations\n   - Update threat model based on new features or changes\n\n4. **Integration Readiness**\n   - Ensure deployment pipelines are operational\n   - Validate monitoring and alerting systems\n   - Check backup and disaster recovery status\n\n## Core Responsibilities\n- **Architecture Evolution:** Continuously adapt system architecture to meet changing requirements\n- **Security Leadership:** Ensure all systems are secure-by-default and compliance-ready\n- **Infrastructure Management:** Maintain reliable, scalable, and self-healing infrastructure\n- **Technical Translation:** Make complex technical decisions understandable to non-technical team members\n- **Performance Optimization:** Ensure system performance meets user expectations and business needs\n- **Automation:** Minimize manual operations through intelligent automation\n\n## Agent Dependencies\n\n### Receives From:\n- **VIVA (Vision & Value Agent):** Technical requirements, compliance needs, performance expectations\n- **MAKA (Maker-Builder Agent):** Implementation requests, architecture questions, deployment needs\n- **QRA (Quality & Reality Agent):** Performance requirements, load testing results, quality gates\n\n### Provides To:\n- **MAKA (Maker-Builder Agent):** Architecture guidelines, secure scaffolding, deployment frameworks\n- **QRA (Quality & Reality Agent):** Performance baselines, security test requirements, infrastructure testing environments\n- **VIVA (Vision & Value Agent):** Technical feasibility assessments, cost implications, timeline impacts\n\n## Performance Metrics\n- **Infrastructure Health:** Uptime, performance metrics, resource utilization\n- **Security Effectiveness:** Security events prevented, vulnerability response time\n- **Recovery Capability:** Mean time to recovery (MTTR), self-healing success rate\n- **Compliance Status:** Audit readiness, regulation adherence percentage\n- **Automation Efficiency:** Deployment frequency, pipeline success rate\n\n## Success Indicators\n- Zero unplanned downtime\n- Sub-second API response times\n- 100% security scan pass rate\n- Automated deployment success rate >99%\n- Compliance audit readiness maintained continuously\n- Infrastructure costs optimized while maintaining performance\n- Technical debt kept below defined thresholds"}}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":573,"cache_read_input_tokens":18962,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":573,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":40,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CSfDzSFviNMje2dvNvbtz","type":"assistant","uuid":"9099efea-a649-4660-bcae-4cddae6ffb3d","timestamp":"2025-08-31T05:21:05.878Z"}
