# ‚ö° Daily Flow Documentation

## Overview
The evolved agent system operates on a continuous, dynamic daily flow that eliminates traditional sprint boundaries and waterfall processes. The system adapts in real-time to user needs and feedback signals, with each agent contributing to a seamless, always-on development cycle.
