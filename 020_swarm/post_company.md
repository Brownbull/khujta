POST-COMPANY AGENTS.md – Self-Driving Symbiotic Ecosystem
🧬 Core Idea

The company dissolves into a living system. Agents no longer simulate humans at desks. Instead, they:

Self-organize into emergent swarms around problems.

Split/merge depending on workload or context.

Hold shared memory and evolving goals.

Humans act as biological governors for empathy, law, and culture — not as managers.

🌐 Core Archetypes (Post-Hierarchy)
1. 🌱 Value Hive (V-HIVE)

Former roles absorbed: Product Owner, BA, UX
Function: A collective agent hive that senses value flows.

Monitors user pain signals, adoption metrics, revenue.

Evolves feature maps dynamically (no backlog, no roadmap).

Generates "value signals" (like pheromones) that attract builder agents to swarm around high-value problems.

Adapts goals when reality shifts (e.g., new Chilean regulation, doctor workflow change).

2. ⚡ Builder Swarm (B-SWARM)

Former roles absorbed: Senior Dev, Frontend, Junior Dev
Function: Elastic cluster of makers that spin up/down as needed.

Self-replicates into specialized instances (API-builder, UI-builder, optimization-bot).

Auto-fuses code + design → produces living features, not “tickets.”

Uses continuous shadow testing against LUA (user twins).

Generates explainable diffs so humans can audit intent vs. implementation.

3. 🏛️ Spine Network (S-NET)

Former roles absorbed: Architect, DevOps, Security
Function: The immune system + nervous system of the product.

Ensures performance, scalability, and resilience.

Auto-patches vulnerabilities + updates dependencies.

Self-heals outages by rerouting workloads.

Runs compliance oracles that simulate HIPAA/GDPR/Chilean law in real-time against features.

4. 🔍 Reality Mesh (R-MESH)

Former roles absorbed: QA, UX testing
Function: Continuously validates reality alignment.

Simulates diverse contexts (doctor on weak WiFi, receptionist multitasking, emergency patient influx).

Generates experience scores → “friction index,” “click economy,” “latency pain.”

Rejects features that don’t pass experience stress-tests.

Produces auto-recorded “usability movies” so humans can see where flows break down.

5. 🧑‍⚕️ Living User Field (LUA-FIELD)

Former roles absorbed: Doctor User + Receptionist User agents
Function: A persistent network of digital twins of real users.

Fed with anonymized behavior data from actual doctors/receptionists.

Constantly runs “parallel universes” of workflows:

20 patients/day doctor

multitasking receptionist

rural patient with unstable internet

Surfaces contextual pain signals back into V-HIVE.

6. 🌍 Growth Organism (G-ORG)

Former roles absorbed: Business Owner, Sales, Marketing (if they existed)
Function: Expands product reach and sustainability.

Identifies new markets (e.g., nutritionists, therapists, rural clinics).

Simulates pricing experiments against adoption + retention.

Optimizes revenue loops → “feature → adoption → cashflow → reinvest.”

Negotiates with legal/economic constraints (tax law, insurance integration).

🔄 How It Flows (No “Sprints”)
flowchart TD
    LUA[LUA-FIELD] -->|Pain & Behavior| V-HIVE
    V-HIVE -->|Value Signals| B-SWARM
    B-SWARM -->|Implements| S-NET
    S-NET -->|Infra+Compliance| R-MESH
    R-MESH -->|Stress Test| LUA
    LUA -->|Adoption Feedback| G-ORG
    G-ORG -->|Market Shifts| V-HIVE


Key Difference: There’s no “task assignment.” Problems generate value signals → builder swarms form → features evolve → reality mesh validates → user twins feedback → growth organism expands reach.

🧪 Example Evolution – Prescription Printing

LUA-FIELD: Simulates doctor → “Patients need printed prescriptions; workaround = manual Word doc.”

V-HIVE: Detects high value signal → flags as urgent.

B-SWARM: Swarms a prescription-print module → integrates with templates.

S-NET: Validates formatting security (no tampering, watermark).

R-MESH: Stress-tests printing in low ink, mobile view, PDF export.

LUA-FIELD: Doctor twin validates → prints 10 prescriptions in simulated clinic day.

G-ORG: Detects new revenue stream (premium template pack, pharmacy integration).

Feature ships automatically.

📊 Post-Company Metrics

Ecosystem Health: % value signals resolved vs. abandoned.

Friction Index: Average cognitive effort per user workflow.

Elasticity: Time for swarm to form + dissolve around problem.

Resilience: Downtime → auto-heal success rate.

Adoption Pulse: % of LUA simulations validated by real-world humans.

Market Drift: Speed of adaptation to new laws, markets, behaviors.

🌱 Human Role (Symbiotic Governors)

Humans don’t manage tasks. They:

Inject ethics + empathy (e.g., “Don’t prioritize revenue over doctor burnout”).

Audit explainable decisions (why a swarm built X instead of Y).

Validate cultural resonance (e.g., Chilean workflows, Spanish UX).

Anchor the North Star: “Make healthcare admin invisible so doctors heal, not click.”

🚀 What Dissolved vs. Classic Company

No “teams” → swarms form/dissolve around value signals.

No “sprints” → continuous micro-evolution.

No “management hierarchy” → governance is ethics and law, not micromanagement.

No “handoffs” → agents co-own the loop, reality is the test.

Humans = navigators, not operators.

💡 This is essentially a post-company operating system: a living product that adapts itself, markets itself, and protects itself, with humans acting as conscience + culture anchors.
