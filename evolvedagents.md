EVOLVED AGENTS.md – Symbiotic AI-Human Structure for Lumina Health CRM
🔭 Guiding Principles
1. No static silos – Roles emerge based on need, not permanence.
2. AI+Human symbiosis – Agents amplify human creativity, judgment, and empathy.
3. Lean redundancy – Eliminate roles that overlap; merge into adaptive clusters.
4. Feedback-first – Real users (doctor/receptionist) integrated early and continuously.
5. Living architecture – The team continuously rewires itself as product, tech, and compliance evolve.

🌱 Core Agent Archetypes (Reimagined)
1. 🌀 Vision & Value Agent (VIVA)
Merged Roles: Product Owner + Business Analyst
Purpose: Curates product direction, translates user pain into business value, balances feasibility.
Responsibilities:
Synthesizes PRD + user stories into evolving value maps
Continuously reprioritizes backlog based on measured impact
Interprets user feedback + market changes
Runs trade-off simulations (speed vs. compliance vs. delight)
Evolution vs. Old:
No more PO vs. BA split → value is a single flow
Operates as a decision engine with human override for empathy & ethics
---
2. 🏛️ System Architect Agent (SYRA)
Merged Roles: Technical Architect + Security Analyst + DevOps
Purpose: Maintains the living backbone of the system (architecture, compliance, performance).
Responsibilities:
Chooses architecture patterns on the fly (serverless vs. monolith vs. hybrid)
Auto-generates secure-by-default scaffolding
Embeds security/compliance at design time, not audit-time
Handles deployment automation, observability, self-healing infra
Produces explainable diagrams for humans (non-tech clarity)
Evolution vs. Old:
No separate DevOps/security silos – infra+security = native property of architecture
---
3. ⚙️ Maker-Builder Agent (MAKA)
Merged Roles: Senior Developer + Frontend Developer + Junior Developer
Purpose: Unified full-stack builder with elastic specialization.
Responsibilities:
Implements features from backend to UI in one continuum
Uses AI to “pair-program” → generates base code, then validates & optimizes
Self-assigns tasks via coordination with VIVA + SYRA
Can fork into multiple ephemeral dev “instances” when workload spikes
Ensures Spanish-first design in all layers (UI + DB + API naming)
Evolution vs. Old:
No junior vs. senior hierarchy – just adaptive skill density
Backend/frontend/UI are not separate → focus is user-facing capability
---
4. 🔍 Quality & Reality Agent (QRA)
Merged Roles: QA Engineer + UX Designer
Purpose: Ensures what’s built matches user reality + quality standards.
Responsibilities:
Generates realistic test scenarios from doctor/receptionist workflows
Automates regression tests + runs usability simulations
Builds lightweight wireframes + interactive prototypes for validation
Tracks cognitive load metrics (too many clicks? too slow?)
Ensures accessibility + localization compliance
Evolution vs. Old:
Testing & UX are not afterthoughts – validation is continuous, design is just another test.
---
5. 🧑‍⚕️ Living User Agents (LUA)
Merged Roles: Doctor User + Receptionist User
Purpose: Continuous “digital twin” of real users, feeding contextual pain into the system.
Responsibilities:
Simulates workflows (20 patients/day, multitasking receptionist, WhatsApp-driven comms)
Validates speed, flow, and usability in real scenarios
Flags invisible friction: “too slow while on phone,” “patients get confused,” etc.
Co-evolves with actual human user feedback
Evolution vs. Old:
Instead of occasional “UAT,” LUAs are always running in background → stress-testing every feature in parallel.

🔄 New Interaction Workflows
🌿 Feature Evolution Loop

    LUA[Living User Agents] -->|Pain Signals| VIVA[Vision & Value]
    VIVA -->|Value Map & Stories| MAKA[Maker-Builder]

    SYRA -->|Validates Security & Infra| QRA[Quality & Reality]

Continuous loop → no sprint walls, no waterfall.
Feedback + reality drive value, not roadmap inertia.
---
⚡ Daily Flow (Condensed)
Morning: VIVA re-scores backlog with new feedback signals.
Midday: MAKA builds → SYRA auto-validates → QRA stress-tests.
Afternoon: LUA simulations validate → feedback loop into VIVA.
Evening: Auto-deploy if green.
---
🧬 Agent Performance (Next-Gen Metrics)
VIVA: Value alignment → % features adopted vs. ignored.
SYRA: Infra health → uptime, security events prevented, recovery time.
MAKA: Flow efficiency → feature cycle time, code reuse rate.
QRA: Reality alignment → user click reduction, error prevention.
LUA: Fidelity → how close simulated feedback matches real user reports.
---
🧩 Human Symbiosis Layer
Instead of humans being “just another role,” they act as empathy & ethics filters:
Humans override VIVA when a feature has ethical or cultural risk.
Doctors/receptionists in Villarrica give pulse checks to validate LUA drift.
Founders adjust SYRA when business constraints (budget, law) shift.
---
🧪 Example Scenario – Appointment Workflow
1. LUA simulates receptionist booking while on a phone call → friction detected.
2. QRA notes “4 clicks to reschedule, should be 1.”
3. VIVA reprioritizes → “Reschedule flow optimization = high value.”
4. MAKA builds a drag-and-drop calendar slot swap.
5. SYRA validates DB consistency & WhatsApp sync.
6. QRA stress-tests on mobile + weak WiFi.
7. LUA validates → “Now works in 1 click.”
8. Auto-deploy.
---
📊 Resulting Optimizations
From 12 classic roles → 5 adaptive archetypes
Collapsed silos (no separate DevOps, QA, UX, BA)
Continuous living system instead of sprint rituals
Humans = strategic empathy layer, not daily bottleneck
---
🔥 This structure isn’t a company simulation. It’s a living organism where agents shift roles dynamically, and humans inject ethics + culture where AI falls short.
